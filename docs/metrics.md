| Abstractness                   | Package        | The number of abstract classes (and interfaces) divided by the total number of types in a package. This metric range is [0,1], where 0 indicates a completely concrete package and 1 indicates a completely abstract package.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [1] |
| Instability                    | Package        | The package’s resilience to change. This metric range is [0,1], where 0 indicates that the package is completely stable and 1 completely unstable. This metric range is [0,1], where 0 indicates that the package is directly on the main sequence whereas 1 indicates that the package is as far away as possible from the main sequence. Small numbers are indicators of good packaging design.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [1] |
| Distance from main sequence    | Package        | The package’s balance between abstractness and stability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [1] |
| Fan In                         | Package, Class | The number of ingoing dependences of a class.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [1] |

| Lines of code                  | Package, Class | The number of lines of code of a given class or package. The metric does not count blank lines and commented lines.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |     |
| Change has occurred (CHO)      | Package, Class | Given the project history (Git commits), it measures whether a class or package has changed or not in the current commit with respect to the previous commit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [2] |
| Code churn (TACH)              | Package, Class | Givent the history of a project (git commits), it is the sum of added lines of code, deleted lines, and twice the changed lines since the last commit for a given class or package.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [2] |
| PageRank                       | Package, Class | Estimates whether an architectural smell is located in an important part of the project, where the importance is evaluated according to how many parts of a project depend on the one involved in the architectural smell. The metric is based on the one implemented by Brin and Page.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [3] |
| Coupling between objects       | Class          | Number of classes to which a class is coupled, that is the number of classes that a class references. The coupling beetween classes should be low, otherwise it will difficult to make changes to the system without change a lot of classes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [4] |
| Depth of inheritance           | Class          | The depth of inheritance tree (DIT) is a code metric that is specific to object-oriented programming.  It measures the maximum length between a node and the root node in a class hierarchy. The minimum value of DIT for a class is 1. The metric range is [0, infinite].  0 indicates a root. The minimum value for a class is 1. A value > 1 indicates that there is code reuse through inheritance.  If there is a majority of values below 2, it may represent poor exploitation of the advantages of OO design and inheritance.  It is recommended a maximum value of 5 since deeper trees constitute greater design complexity. | [4] |
| Number of children             | Class          | The number of classes inheriting from a given class.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [4] |
| Number of architectural smells | Project        | The total number of architectural smells detected by Arcan in the analysed project.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |     |
| Number of components           | Project        | The sum of number of classes and packages of the analysed project.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |     |
