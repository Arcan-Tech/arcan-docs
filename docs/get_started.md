# Get Started

## Create and analyse a new project
Open Arcan dashboard at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Click on the "ADD NEW " button to analyse a new project.

- Fill out the form on the "Add new project" page with the project's name and the programming language you want to analyse.
- To analyse a *remote* project, use the remote repo URL when creating a new project. If the repo is private, remember to use a personal access token as password by ticking the "Project requires authentication" box.
- To analyse a *local* project, copy the project folder into `/arcan-trial/projects`. When creating a new project, specify the path to analyse as follows: `./projects/<folder_name>`.
- In "Configure analysis" click on "ANALYSE" and then "CONTINUE" to trigger the analysis. Once the analysis is completed, you can interact with the project card on the "My projects" page.
